# Movie Search App

This app was build following <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-hooks-24eb72ddfaf7/">this</a> tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 

I changed a few things on the layout and I'm using this app to experiment and study new things. I'll be updating... 

To run this app you will need 

1. Download <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a> (If you don't have it already)

2. Run <b>npm install</b>

3. Run <b>npm start</b>
